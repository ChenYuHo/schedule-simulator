"""
This module provides multiple low level schedulers that can be used to prioritize any tasks or jobs in a certain way.
Each processing unit must have a unique scheduler in which it uses to choose which task to work on.
You should not deal with any of the schedulers methods directly. Instead you simply pass an instance of it the processing
unit and it will handle the rest.

I did not use the synchronized queue module in any of the schedulers and synchronized manually.
This is because the queue module does not support peeking for some reason.
